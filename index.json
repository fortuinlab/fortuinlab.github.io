newly completed (Oct. 2016) detector system of Extensive Air Showers (EAS) called Horizon-T (HT) is a part of Tien Shan high-altitude Science Station of Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, which is located 32 km from Almaty at the altitude of 3340 meters above the sea level. Horizon-T is constructed to study Extensive Air Showers in the energy range above ∼1016 eV coming from a wide range of zenith angles (0° - 85°). The system currently has eight working and two under construction charged particle detection points separated by the distance more than a kilometer. The ability to record each detector response with accuracy of 2 ns gives HT ability to study the temporary structure of EAS disk and apply the results to the event reconstruction. The reconstruction is therefore based on chronotron (\u003c 0.5 ns), spatial and temporary distribution of charged particles within the detected EAS event. In this paper, we will show the simulated time distribution of charged particles in the EAS disk vs. distance from the axis and the correspondence to the data. A flow of the reconstruction of standard EAS events and the event display is presented as well as recent HT results.","tags":null,"title":"Extensive air showers event reconstruction using spatial and
